# HumanityCast

Humanity Cast is a farcaster client forked from [opencast](https://github.com/opencast/opencast) that verifies the humanity of its users. Read below for Opencast instructions.

# Opencast

A fully open source Twitter flavoured Farcaster client. Originally a fork of [ccrsxx/twitter-clone](https://github.com/ccrsxx/twitter-clone).

The goal of this project is to be a fully standalone Farcaster client that you can run on your own machine. It only depends on [stephancill/lazy-indexer](https://github.com/stephancill/lazy-indexer) and a connection to a Farcaster Hub.

## Running it yourself

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

1. Clone the repo

```
git clone git@github.com:stephancill/opencast.git
```

2. Copy .env.sample, rename it to .env and fill in the values

```
cp .env.sample .env
```

3. Run the Docker Compose file

```
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Go to Opencast at http://localhost:3000 and log in. It will take a few moments to index your profile and might require you to refresh the page.
